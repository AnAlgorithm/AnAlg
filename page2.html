<p><h3>Speedcubing or speedsolving is the method of solving a cube in record time. Speedcubers over the world attend competitions
and try to set the world record for that year. Lots of speedcubers compete, but only one can win.

Feliks Aleksanders Zemdegs is an Australian Rubik's Cube speedsolver. He is the only speedcuber to ever win the World Cube Association World Championship twice. Wikipedia
<p>Born: 20 December 1995 (age 24 years), Melbourne, Australia</p>
<p>Nationality: Australian</p>
<p>Full name: Feliks A. Zemdegs</p>
<p>Other name: Faz</p>
Zemdegs has a Latvian ancestry and his maternal grandmother is Lithuanian.[4] Zemdegs bought his first speedcube in April 2008 after being inspired by speedcubing videos and tutorials on YouTube.[5] The first unofficial time he recorded was an average of 19.73 seconds on 14 June 2008.[6] He has been using CFOP to solve the 3×3×3 since he was 12 years old, the Yau method to solve the 4×4×4, the CLL method to solve the 2×2×2, and the Reduction method for 5×5×5 through 7×7×7.[citation needed]

Zemdegs won the 3×3×3 event at the first competition he attended, the New Zealand's Champs 2009 on 18 July 2009, with an average of 13.74 seconds in the final round. He also won 2×2×2, 4×4×4, 5×5×5, 3×3×3 blindfolded, and 3×3×3 one-handed.[7]

At his next competition, the Melbourne Summer Open 2010 on 30 January 2010, Zemdegs set his first world records for 3×3×3 average and 4×4×4 average, with times of 9.21 seconds and 42.01 seconds respectively.[8] He held the 3×3×3 average world record continuously from then until 23 April 2017, improving it 8 times, eventually to 6.45 seconds. The most world records he has ever held at one time was after a competition in Melbourne in May 2011, when he held 12 records. As recently as 28 January 2017, he held 11 of those records concurrently.

At the World Championship 2011 in Bangkok, Zemdegs won 2×2×2, 4×4×4, 5×5×5, and 6×6×6. He also took third in 3×3×3 after winning the first three rounds, and placed third in 7×7×7.[9] At the next world championship, World Championship 2013 in Las Vegas, Zemdegs won 3×3×3, 4×4×4, and 3×3×3 One-handed. He also placed second in 5×5×5 and third in 7×7×7.[10] At World Championship 2015 in São Paulo, Zemdegs won 3×3×3, 2×2×2, 4×4×4, and 5×5×5. He also placed second in 6×6×6, 7×7×7, and Megaminx.[11] At the World Championship 2017 in Paris, Zemdegs won 5×5×5 and 7×7×7. He also took second in 6×6×6, 3×3×3 One-handed, and Megaminx, and placed third in 4×4×4.[12] At the World Championship 2019 in Melbourne, Zemdegs only podiumed in one event, getting third in 5x5x5.[13]

Zemdegs has a website, CubeSkills, which includes tutorials on solving the Rubik's cube and other puzzles. There are free algorithm sheets, and some free speed solving tutorial videos. The site also offers a premium membership, which enables access to advanced speed solving videos. Members can also submit their own solving videos which Zemdegs will critique.

Mats Valk is a Dutch Rubik's Cube speedsolver. He broke the Rubik's cube single solve world record twice with times of 5.55 seconds in 2013 and 4.74 seconds in 2016. Wikipedia
<p>Born: 4 May 1996 (age 23 years), Amstelveen, Netherlands</p>
<p>Nationality: Dutch</p>
Valk was born and raised in Amstelveen, the Netherlands, a suburb of the Dutch capital Amsterdam.

Valk is most famous for breaking the Rubik's cube world record twice and being the runner-up at both the Rubik's cube world championships of 2013[2][3] and 2015.[4][5] He first broke the world record with a time of 5.55 seconds at the Zonhoven Open 2013 in Belgium on 3 March 2013. This record stood for over 2 years. He later broke the world record again with a time of 4.74 seconds at the Jawa Timur Open 2016 in Indonesia on 6 November 2016. In December 2016, Valk looked on as Feliks Zemdegs overtook his world record by just 0.01 seconds.

Valk has also set three 4x4x4 world records, two for single solve and one for an average of 5. His second single world record, 26.77 seconds on 15 April 2012, was the first official 4x4x4 solve under 30 seconds. Altogether, Valk has broken 5 WCA world records, 17 European records, and 127 Dutch national records. Valk also currently holds the world record for solving the most Rubik's cubes in 1 hour, 374 cubes, set in Paris on 21 October 2015.

Valk is also known as a creator of the VLS (Valk Last Slot) 3x3x3 algorithm set, which correctly orients the last layer while inserting the last corner-edge pair of the first two layers. Valk used one of these algorithms to complete the cube in his 2016 3x3x3 world record.

Kevin Hays is an American Rubik's Cube speedcuber. Recognized as an expert at solving big cubes, he has won 6 world championship titles and set 21 world records across the three events. He has also set 47 North American records and won 21 US National titles. Wikipedia
<p>Born: 12 May 1994 (age 25 years)</p>
Personal life
Hays grew up in Renton, Washington, where he started speedcubing during his freshman year of high school in January 2009.[2] Hays then attended college and continued speedcubing at Washington University in St. Louis.[3] He now lives in Seattle, WA.[4]

In 2019, Hays competed on the American television game show series Mental Samurai, making it to the second round.

Speedsolving career
At Hays' first competition, US Nationals 2009, Hays placed 4th in the 6x6 event and made finals in the 5x5 event. The following Summer, at US Nationals 2010, Hays won the national title in the 6x6 event, finishing with a winning average of 2:36.44.[5] Hays broke his first world records the next year at US Nationals 2011, solving the 6x6 cube in world record single and average times of 2:02.31 and 2:09.03 respectively.[1]

Hays attended his first World Championships in October 2011 in Bangkok, Thailand. Despite holding the 6x6 world record average that he set at 2011 US Nationals, Hays placed last in the finals, with a result of DNF (Did Not Finish).
