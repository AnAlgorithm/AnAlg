<div align="center"><h3>Greatest speedcubers</div>
<p><h3>Speedcubing or speedsolving is the method of solving a cube in record time. Speedcubers over the world attend competitions
and try to set the world record for that year. Lots of speedcubers compete, but only one can win. 
A few examples are-</h3></p>

Feliks Aleksanders Zemdegs is an Australian Rubik's Cube speedsolver. He is the only speedcuber to ever win the World Cube Association World Championship twice. Wikipedia
<p>Born: 20 December 1995 (age 24 years), Melbourne, Australia</p>
<p>Nationality: Australian</p>
<p>Full name: Feliks A. Zemdegs</p>
<p>Other name: Faz</p>
Zemdegs has a Latvian ancestry and his maternal grandmother is Lithuanian. Zemdegs bought his first speedcube in April 2008 after being inspired by speedcubing videos and tutorials on YouTube. The first unofficial time he recorded was an average of 19.73 seconds on 14 June 2008. He has been using CFOP to solve the 3×3×3 since he was 12 years old, the Yau method to solve the 4×4×4, the CLL method to solve the 2×2×2, and the Reduction method for 5×5×5 through 7×7×7.

Zemdegs won the 3×3×3 event at the first competition he attended, the New Zealand's Champs 2009 on 18 July 2009, with an average of 13.74 seconds in the final round. He also won 2×2×2, 4×4×4, 5×5×5, 3×3×3 blindfolded, and 3×3×3 one-handed.
Zemdegs has a website, CubeSkills, which includes tutorials on solving the Rubik's cube and other puzzles. There are free algorithm sheets, and some free speed solving tutorial videos. The site also offers a premium membership, which enables access to advanced speed solving videos. Members can also submit their own solving videos which Zemdegs will critique.
